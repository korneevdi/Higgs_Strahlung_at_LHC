Setting up crossings for kinematics ''
Crossing equivalence: '' -> ''
External legs:
  external leg 1 is incoming, has momenta p1 and mass 0
  external leg 2 is incoming, has momenta p2 and mass 0
  external leg 3 is outgoing, has momenta pw and mass mw^2
  external leg 4 is outgoing, has momenta -pw-p5+p2+p1 and mass s-2*mw^2+u+s35-s15+t-s25
  external leg 5 is outgoing, has momenta p5 and mass 0
Rules to replace scalar products by kinematic invariants:
  SP(pw,p5) -> -1/2*mw^2+1/2*s35
  SP(p5,p1) -> 1/2*s15
  SP(p1,p1) -> 0
  SP(p5,p2) -> 1/2*s25
  SP(pw,pw) -> mw^2
  SP(p2,p2) -> 0
  SP(pw,p1) -> 1/2*mw^2-1/2*t
  SP(p5,p5) -> 0
  SP(pw,p2) -> 1/2*mw^2-1/2*u
  SP(p2,p1) -> 1/2*s
Permutations of external legs (before completing):
[]
[[1, 2]]
[[1, 2, 5]]
[[1, 5]]
[[1, 5, 2]]
[[2, 5]]
Discarding invalid crossings due to numeric kinematic invariants:
discarded 0 crossings
