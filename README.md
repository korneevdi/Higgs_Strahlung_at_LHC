## Easy Introduction :)

My PhD project was dedicated to performing some complex calculations in the field of quantum field theory. Perhaps, at least once in your life, looking at the starry sky, you wondered why our world exists and where it came from. You may know that our Universe was born as a result of the Big Bang. So let's do a thought experiment. Imagine a picture of space with galaxies, nebulae and planets.

Now let's turn back the clock. Then we will see how galaxies and other objects come closer to each other and, finally, at time zero, gather at one point. Now let's start the timer again. At this moment the Big Bang occurs and our Universe is born. The universe begins to expand and eventually reaches its current size.

Such thought experiments are very often conducted by scientists and help us find answers to fundamental questions. For example, what is mass and where does it come from? You know that all objects in the world are made up of small particles such as electrons and others. This means that these particles also have mass. But why? According to modern ideas, this is due to the existence of a particle such as the Higgs boson, also called the God particle, since when interacting with it, other particles acquire their specific mass.

There are several laboratories around the world that are looking for answers to similar questions. One of them is located in Switzerland, this is CERN. In this laboratory, beams of particles collide at very high speeds. After the collision at the collision point, the energy and temperature reach such enormous values as at the moment of the Big Bang. This allows us to create and study Big Bang conditions in the laboratory.

Today we know very little about the Higgs boson. While working on my doctoral dissertation, I studied the properties of this particle. I studied the quantum processes that occurred in the Universe during the Big Bang and presented my results at CERN. This will significantly narrow the search area in future CERN experiments in 2025-2026.

I assume that you understand that experiments at CERN are very expensive, and therefore only the most reliable theoretical predictions are taken into account and tested. Because of this, I had to use several different approaches leading to the same goal in order to get the most accurate results.

As part of this project, I performed complex analytical calculations, developed several Python programs for some predictions using machine learning methods and numerical verification of the results, and also developed an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface in Java for visual perception of the results. As a result, my project brought together many different ideas and approaches that helped me achieve reliable and accurate results that the client was happy with.

## Technical description of the project

#### Step #1: Identify specific quantum processes to research

CERN conducts a large number of experiments on particle collisions. Particles are accelerated by a magnetic field to enormous speeds and collide at enormous energies, after which other particles appear at the point of collision. Special detectors measure various parameters of these particles and this data is entered into a database. Next, you can analyze the results of the experiments and find out which particles appeared in the experiments.

This was the first step of my project - to analyze a large amount of data from real experiments at CERN and understand which quantum processes we need to research in order to quickly achieve our goal, namely, to study the properties of the Higgs boson. To do this, I used some machine learning techniques to cluster quantum processes in experiments.

#### Step #2: Perform analytical computations

In the first step of my project, I found out that the most important quantum process occurring in the CERN experiments is the creation of the Higgs boson when two **partons** collide. **Parton** is a conventional name for a certain group of particles. All matter in the Universe (at least 4% that is not dark matter and dark energy) is made up of atoms, all of which are listed in the periodic table. These atoms, in turn, are made up of electrons that orbit atomic nuclei. The nuclei of atoms consist of protons and neutrons. But that is not all. Protons and neutrons are divided into even smaller particles - quarks and gluons. It is these quarks and gluons that we call **partons**.

In addition to the particles that make up matter, there are other particles. For example, **photons** that make up light. Photons are also carriers of electromagnetic interactions (such as the attraction or repulsion of electric charges). The **Higgs boson** helps particles gain mass. The so-called weak interaction is carried out through three particles - **electroweak bosons** $W^+$, $W^-$ and $Z^0$. Plus, minus and zero denote the electric charge.

In most CERN experiments, beams of protons collide. However, the temperature and energy are maintained so high that the protons do not exist as a whole, but break up into their component parts, that is, into partons. Thus, partons actually participate in collisions. After the collision, these particles turn into other particles, the properties of which I studied in the first step of my project. So the quantum process I studied in my project looks like this: $PP \rightarrow VH$, where $P$ denotes a parton (quark or gluon), V denotes an electroweak boson ($W^+$, $W^-$ or $Z^0$), and $H$ denotes the Higgs boson:

Here, two different partons collide and a weak boson appear that then emits a Higgs boson and subsequently decays into a lepton and a nuetrino. QCD corrections are the complex small (but very important) quantum corrections that have been studied in this project.
