# How to use this example

*You need to have installed the dependecies to execute this example. Start by downloading and setting up QGRAF and tikz-feynman.*

Run *QGRAF* with this input file `qgraf.dat`. This will generate the Standard Model diagrams for Higgs production through gluon fusion at one loop in an XML format file called `grafs`. Put this file in the code main folder and execute `python drawer.py`. Then compile using `lualatex main.tex`. This generates `main.pdf` with the two diagrams.
