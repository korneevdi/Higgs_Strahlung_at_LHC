Setting up crossings for kinematics ''
Crossing equivalence: '' -> ''
External legs:
  external leg 1 is incoming, has momenta p1 and mass 0
  external leg 2 is incoming, has momenta p2 and mass 0
  external leg 3 is outgoing, has momenta p3 and mass mw^2
  external leg 4 is outgoing, has momenta -p3+p2+p1 and mass mh^2
Rules to replace scalar products by kinematic invariants:
  SP(p1,p1) -> 0
  SP(p3,p3) -> mw^2
  SP(p2,p2) -> 0
  SP(p3,p1) -> -1/2*t+1/2*mw^2
  SP(p3,p2) -> 1/2*t+1/2*s-1/2*mh^2
  SP(p2,p1) -> 1/2*s
Permutations of external legs (before completing):
[]
[[1, 2]]
Discarding invalid crossings due to numeric kinematic invariants:
discarded 0 crossings
Completing the permutations:
Permutations of external legs:
[]
[[1, 2]]
Generating crossings:
  generated crossing [[1, 2]]
Number of crossings (identity included): 2
