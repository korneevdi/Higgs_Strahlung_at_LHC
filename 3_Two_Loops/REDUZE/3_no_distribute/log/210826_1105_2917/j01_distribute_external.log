Step 1: determine external* and explicit input files

Determining sectors in selection
  normalizing user input
  selecting all sectors
    considering top level sector (T1:9:511)
    considering top level sector (T2:9:511)
  selecting explicit sectors
  selecting recursively
  deselecting explicit sectors
  deselecting recursively
  deselecting sectors by t restriction
