We consider the process q\bar{q}' -> ggVH -> ggHl\bar{l}.

Momenta
    incoming quark q(p1)
    incoming antiquark \bar{q}'(p2)
    intermediate electroweak boson V(pV)
    Higgs boson V(pH)
    outgoing lepton l(p4)
    outgoing antilepton \bar{l}(p3)
    1st outgoing gluon g(p5)
    2nd outgoing gluon g(p6)

Momentum conservation law: p1 + p2 = pV + pH + p5 +p6 = p3 + p4 + pH + p5 + p6.

Every amplitude is written as a function iM, its arguments are helicities of the particles: q, \bar{q}', l, \bar{l}, g(p5), g(p6), respectively.

Helicity amplitudes are written as functions, their arguments are "square" (for [pi,pj]) or "angle" (for <pi,pj>) and the corresponding momenta.

CF is the quadratic Casimir operator of the fundamental representation of group SU(N).

Nc is the number of colors.

gw is the electroweak coupling.

gs is the strong coupling.

Numbers A, B, C, D are related to the corresponding Wilson coefficients C_i:

    A = I*C_{uW}^{\dagger}*V
    B = I*V*C_{dW}
    C = I*Sqrt[2]*gw*v*V*C_{phi q 3}
    D = I*gw*v/Sqrt[2]*V*C_{phi u d}

I is imaginary unit.
V is the CKM-matrix.
v is the vacuum expectation value.

Invariants:

      s = (p1 + p2)^2
      s15 = (p1 - p5)^2
      s16 = (p1 - p6)^2
      s25 = (p2 - p5)^2
      s26 = (p2 - p6)^2
      s56 = (p5 + p6)^2
      t = (p1 - pV)^2
      u = (p2 - pV)^2
      MV is the mass of electroweak boson
      MH is the mass of Higgs boson
